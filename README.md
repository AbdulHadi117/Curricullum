## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Java 17+**
* **Swing** for GUI
* **Shell Script (`run.sh`)** for build automation

## 🚀 Usage

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbdulHadi117/Curricullum
cd Curricullum
```

### 2️⃣ Configure Base Directory

- Edit `assets/path.txt`
- Add the **full absolute path** where you want your semester and course folders to be managed, e.g.:

```
C:/Users/YourName/Documents/Academics
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Application

Make `run.sh` executable and run:

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

This will:

* Compile Java files from `src/` to `build/`
* Run the application from the compiled classes
